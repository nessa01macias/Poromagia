# Poromagia

The aim of the project is to produce a card sorter for a company called Poromagia. Poromagia distributes collectible cards and other products related to gaming. The value of the Magic The Gathering collectible cards in the project varies from a few cents per card 
to thousands of euros, and collections of cards handled in the company's warehouse can contain thousands of euros in cards. Automated sorting and initial sorting of collections saves significant amounts of time and money. 
manual work and, in the best case, reduce errors. The project aims to design and manufacture a machine that sorts the cards in different categories, such as "price", "stock" or "wanted".
The idea is to use a camera to identify the top card in the deck. After the picture is taken, the software which also contains a computer vision model, knows the value of the card and uses a suction cup to move the card to the right place. 
Suction cup between the different card positions is implemented by means of a moving plane. The moving plane moves
by means of a stepper motor on the frame. The purpose of the platform is to move the suction cup arm to the correct position and 
lower the card into the correct housing. There are five card slots, a shuffled deck, valuable cards, 
medium-priced cards, cheap cards and unidentified cards. The device 
is controlled via a touch screen, which allows the selection of the correct programme for the cards 
for sorting the cards.
